## Advanced Support Features

### Super User Role Assumption

#### Feature Overview
```yaml
Purpose:
- Enable support team to troubleshoot client issues directly
- Provide exact client perspective for accurate diagnosis
- Streamline support process and reduce resolution time
- Maintain full audit trail of support activities

Capabilities:
- Assume role of any specific user (Admin, Campaign Manager, Reporting Manager)
- Access client account with user's exact permissions
- Perform operations within user's context
- View data and interface exactly as client sees it
- Switch between multiple client contexts as needed
```

#### Usage Procedures
```yaml
Access Requirements:
- Super User role assignment required
- Multi-factor authentication enabled
- Approval from support manager for sensitive accounts
- Documentation of business justification

Assumption Process:
1. List available accounts and users via support interface
2. Select specific user to assume (not abstract role)
3. Receive temporary authentication key for selected user
4. Switch client interface to assumed user context
5. Perform troubleshooting and support activities
6. Document all actions taken during assumption
7. Release assumed role and return to super user context

Security Controls:
- All assumptions logged with full audit trail
- Session timeout after 2 hours of inactivity
- Automatic release on logout or session end
- Cannot assume other Super User roles
- Regular access review and approval process
```

#### Implementation Example
```javascript
// Support interface for role assumption
class SupportRoleManager {
    async listAvailableUsers() {
        const response = await api.get('/v1/vt/auth.ListAccountsAndUsers');
        return response.accounts;
    }
    
    async assumeUserRole(userId) {
        const assumption = await api.post('/v1/vt/auth.AssumeUserRole', {
            userId: userId
        });
        
        // Store original auth key
        this.originalAuthKey = api.getAuthKey();
        
        // Switch to assumed user context
        api.setAuthKey(assumption.authKey);
        
        // Update UI to show assumed context
        this.showAssumedContext(assumption.targetUser, assumption.account);
        
        // Log assumption for audit
        this.logRoleAssumption(assumption);
        
        return assumption;
    }
    
    async releaseUserRole() {
        await api.post('/v1/vt/auth.ReleaseUserRole');
        
        // Restore original auth key
        api.setAuthKey(this.originalAuthKey);
        
        // Update UI to hide assumed context
        this.hideAssumedContext();
        
        // Log release for audit
        this.logRoleRelease();
    }

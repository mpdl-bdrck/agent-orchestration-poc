# Bedrock Platform Overview

## What is Bedrock Platform?

Bedrock Platform is a highly customizable, commercially flexible, and media-agnostic AdTech platform that enables programmatic activation of specialized data and media businesses. We provide a complete demand-side platform (DSP) solution designed specifically for verticalized ad networks and independent agencies.

## Our Vision

Bedrock Platform provides a highly customizable, commercially flexible, and media-agnostic AdTech platform that enables programmatic activation of specialized data and media businesses.

### Core Product Philosophy

As a **Curation Platform**, we provide infrastructure for customers to activate their data and custom processes on RTB media, following the **Supply → Curate → Activate** workflow.

#### We Believe In:
1. **Transformation**: Advertising media will eventually all be bought programmatically via Open RTB. We're seeing continued trends where advertising becomes digital, digital becomes addressable, and addressable becomes programmatic with Open RTB as the trading protocol.

2. **Pioneers**: Innovation to address new market opportunities will be driven by pioneering users and businesses finding new programmatic business models, but they'll be underserved by current platforms. We aim to serve these pioneers.

## Who We Serve

### Primary Target Market: Verticalized Ad Networks
Bedrock's primary target market is **Verticalized Ad Networks** that have unique data and/or capabilities for a specific advertiser vertical whose business model does not fit the product offerings of agency and brand-focused AdTech platforms.

**Specific Opportunities**:
- **Barter ad networks** poorly addressed by current programmatic solutions
- **Forward purchasing ad networks** with unique business models
- **Unique data providers** with specialized audience insights
- **Vertical-specific capabilities** for targeted advertiser segments

### Secondary Market: Independent Agencies & SME Advertisers
Once successful with Verticalized Ad Networks, the data and capabilities built into Bedrock Platform become a springboard to the second target market:
- **Independent Agencies** leveraging specialized data and capabilities
- **SME advertisers** requiring cost-effective campaign management  
- **Businesses seeking** customizable bidding and targeting capabilities

## What Makes Us Different

### Competitive Advantages
- **Customizable platform** vs. rigid enterprise solutions
- **Flexible commercial models** vs. high minimum fees
- **Media-agnostic approach** vs. limited inventory access
- **Specialized data activation** vs. generic targeting

### Market Gap We Fill

#### Primary Competitors (Acquired & Deprioritized)
**Beeswax** (acquired by Comcast) and **BidCore by IPONWEB** (acquired by Criteo) previously targeted customers requiring customizable and media-agnostic solutions. These platforms have since stagnated and been deprioritized by their larger owners, **leaving a gap in the market for Bedrock to address**.

#### Secondary Competitors (Large-Scale Focus)
**Larger DSPs and SSPs** like Google's DV360, The Trade Desk, StackAdapt, Xandr, Magnite provide end-to-end programmatic solutions but focus on large Agencies and Brands. Their **media-driven commercial model and high minimum monthly fees** make these platforms difficult to justify commercially for our target clients. The **inflexibility of features and functionality** is also problematic for those creating new bespoke programmatic business models.

#### Alternative Solutions (Unproven & Risky)
Multiple smaller companies offer custom-built solutions but are **unproven and require much heavier upfront investment**, making them a riskier proposition.

## Core Platform Components

The Bedrock Platform comprises **three core products** that cater to different customer profiles and use cases:

### Bedrock Supply (Direct)
- **Purpose**: Direct publisher integrations mainly via Prebid adapter
- **Function**: Prioritized demand routing of private and investment deals to publishers from Bedrock Demand clients
- **Benefit**: Direct access to premium inventory at negotiated rates

### Bedrock Curation  
- **Purpose**: Enable data providers to monetize their data assets through curation of the bid stream
- **Function**: Enhance or shape bid requests through data enrichment and targeting
- **Benefit**: Unlock value from unique data assets through programmatic activation

### Bedrock Bidder
- **Purpose**: Bespoke Demand Side Bidder instance
- **Function**: Custom bidder logic, machine learning, campaign management, and reporting via white-label user interface and APIs
- **Benefit**: Fully customizable solution tailored to specific business needs and requirements

## Business Model

### Commercial Model
1. **Monthly recurring license fees** with minimums
2. **CPM uplift charge** for prepay customers  
3. **SOW and CPM-based Data Usage fees**
4. **Custom dedicated instance model pricing**

### Revenue Targets
- **$300 Million USD** in Media Spend (approximately 0.05% of global programmatic ad spend of $700 billion by 2026)
- **$50 Million USD** in ARR - Net Revenue

### Cost Model
- **Cloud computing costs** (primary operational expense)
- **Additional costs** to be determined based on scale and feature requirements

### Go-To-Market Strategy
The initial go-to-market strategy will rely heavily on the **First Party Capital network** of companies and users. Bedrock will have a unique product positioning of a **bespoke programmatic platform** with focus on serving programmatic business models that are poorly supported by large DSPs and SSPs.

## Competitive Intelligence

### Historical Competitor Analysis

#### Beeswax (Acquired by Comcast)
**Previous Positioning**: "Sophisticated programmatic buyers should invest in technology and build capabilities that make them stand out from the crowd"

**Pricing Model**: QPS (Queries Per Second) based pricing
- **Philosophy**: Price like enterprise software based on server resources and execution needs
- **Scale Example**: 10,000 QPS = 864 million auctions per day (86.4 million impressions at 10% win rate)
- **Customer Control**: Impression delivery entirely based on bidding strategy, bid prices, and demand

#### BidCore by IPONWEB (Acquired by Criteo)  
**Previous Positioning**: "Put Your Data to Work, Securely and at Scale"

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Activation Without Limits**: No limits on 1st-party data volumes or file sizes
- **Log-Level Trading Data**: Complete access to trading logs (no bid, yes bid, impression, click, view, conversion)
- **Powerful Data Analytics**: Full transparency with custom metrics and reporting
- **Real-Time Data Augmentation**: Bid decisioning based on proprietary data intelligence

**Integration Flexibility**:
- **Intuitive UIs**: Standard campaign management and reporting tools
- **Flexible APIs**: Integration into existing workflows  
- **Real-Time Bid Enrichment**: Custom intelligence and algorithmic integration

### Market Opportunity
Both platforms offered the customization and flexibility our target market needs, but their acquisition by larger companies has created the **market gap Bedrock now addresses**.

# PNP-009: Support Multiple Playback Modes in Background Monitor

**Status**: 🔴 To Do  
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Background Monitor Integration  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Assignee**: TBD

---

## Description

Implement support for streaming, static, and replay playback modes in the background monitor.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Streaming mode: Alerts appear one at a time at specified interval
- [ ] Static mode: All alerts appear at once, then waits 5 minutes
- [ ] Replay mode: Uses `delay_seconds` from each alert for precise timing
- [ ] Mode determined from JSON settings
- [ ] Mode can be changed by reloading JSON
- [ ] Each mode works correctly independently

## Dependencies

- PNP-007 (background_monitor function)
- PNP-004 (playback modes in loader)

## Notes

This ensures all three playback modes work correctly in the background monitor.

# PNP-004: Implement NotificationLoader Class with Playback Modes

**Status**: 🔴 To Do  
**Phase**: Phase 1 - JSON-Driven Notification System  
**Priority**: High  
**Assignee**: TBD

---

## Description

Implement the core `NotificationLoader` class functionality including support for streaming, static, and replay playback modes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Streaming mode: `get_next_alert()` returns one alert at a time, cycles through alerts
- [ ] Static mode: `get_all_alerts()` returns all alerts at once
- [ ] Replay mode: Uses `delay_seconds` from each alert for precise timing
- [ ] Loop support: When `loop: true` in settings, cycles back to start when all alerts shown
- [ ] Max alerts limiting: Respects `max_alerts` setting from JSON
- [ ] State management: Tracks current position in alert sequence
- [ ] Mode switching: Can handle mode changes via `reload()`

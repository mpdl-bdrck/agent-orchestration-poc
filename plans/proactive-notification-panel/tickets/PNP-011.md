# PNP-011: Support Multiple Playback Modes and Error Handling

**Status**: 🔴 To Do  
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Background Monitor (Native Messages)  
**Priority**: High  
**Assignee**: TBD

---

## Description

Implement support for all three playback modes (streaming, static, replay) and robust error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Streaming mode: gets next alert, sends message, waits interval
- [ ] Static mode: loads all alerts, sends all at once, waits 5 minutes
- [ ] Replay mode: uses delay_seconds from each alert for precise timing
- [ ] Loop support: resets loader and continues when alerts exhausted
- [ ] Error handling: catches exceptions, logs errors, waits 60s before retry
- [ ] Continues running even if individual alerts fail
- [ ] Logs mode and interval on startup

## Dependencies

- PNP-008 (NotificationLoader integration)

## Notes

Error handling is critical - monitor must be resilient to failures. See implementation plan section "2. Background Monitor" for mode details.

# Web Interface (Placeholder)

This directory is reserved for future web UI development.

The Agentic CRAG Launchpad is currently CLI-first, with all core functionality accessible through the terminal interface.

## Future Web UI Plans

- Web-based chat interface
- Knowledge base management UI
- Visualization of agent reasoning and tool calls
- Real-time CRAG metrics dashboard
- Multi-user support

## Current Interface

Use the CLI interface at `src/interface/cli/main.py` for all interactions.
